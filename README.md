## My First HTML & CSS Project

This project marks my first steps into front-end web development, where I focused on building a static webpage using HTML and CSS. The goal was to understand the fundamental structure of a webpage, layout styling, and responsive design principles.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a simple, visually appealing webpage that showcases my ability to use basic HTML elements and apply CSS styles. I implemented core design concepts such as color schemes, typography, and layout, ensuring the page is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## Technologies Used

**HTML:** To structure the content and define the basic elements of the webpage.

**CSS**: To style the page and implement various layout and design features.
Responsive Design: Ensuring the webpage adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.

**Key Features**

- Basic styling applied to text, images, and layout.
- Simple responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices.

**Future Improvements**

- Explore more advanced CSS features like animations and transitions.

- Learning Experience

This project gave me a solid foundation in using HTML and CSS, helping me to understand the importance of clean, semantic code and the basics of responsive design. I look forward to building upon these skills in future projects!
